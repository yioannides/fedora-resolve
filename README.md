<h6 align="center"> This is a Davinci Resolve auto-installation script for Fedora 40+, that also introduces AMD GPU fixes, as well as a h.264 video encoder plugin fix (for exporting only) and a transcoding script for the free version of Resolve.</h6>

## Installation

Execute the following command in Terminal:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yioannides/fedora-resolve.git && cd fedora-resolve && chmod +x ./install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```
<sup>* to install the Studio version, add the optional argument `--studio` at the end of the script above

## Things to consider next

### No mp4 import / AAC audio format

Due to licensing issues, it is not possible to import mp4 files on the free Linux version of Davinci Resolve. 
Therefore, installing the free version of Resolve also includes:
- a transcoder script for batch conversion from .mp4 to .mov (via `ffmpeg`)
- an additional mp4 encoder plugin (for exporting only)

To automatically batch-convert .mp4 videos to .mov: 
1. `cd` onto your project's media folder and
2. simply type `transcode`

All of the converted files will be on a new folder called "transcoded", inside your media folder. If you prefer .avi, find the transcode alias script in `~/.bashrc` and change all "mov" strings to "avi".

<sup>* please pay close attention to your disk space after converting to .avi and .mov, or else you might end up with hundreds of gigabytes worth of converted files!

### User fonts

If you want to use your own fonts in Davinci Resolve for text input, you have to copy them in your system's font folder: `usr/share/fonts`

Your local user font folder in `~/.fonts` won't be seen by Davinci Resolve.
